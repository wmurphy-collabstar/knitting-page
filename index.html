        <p>Knit stitch is one of the two most powerful stitches in knitting. Many other types of stitches are based on the knit stitch.</p>
        <p>Here are the steps to knit below.</p>
        <code>
          /*
          First, slide the right needle through the hole in the stitch behind the left needle.
          Second, wrap the yarn around the right needle once clockwise.
          Third, pull the new loop out of the old loop with your needle.
          Go to the next stitch.
          I also list extra resources to learn the knit stitch.

        <p>Purl stitch is the other most powerful stitch type in knitting. Same about knit stitch applies to a purl stitch.</p>
        <p>Here are the steps to purl below.</p>
        <code>
          /*
          First, slide the right needle through the hole in the stitch from above and in front of the left needle.
          Second, wrap the yarn around the right needle once clockwise.
          Third, pull the new loop out of the old loop with your needle.
          Go to the next stitch.

        <p>One important thing to keep in mind is the thickness of the needles. Thicker needles work well with thicker yarn,
          while thinner needles work for more delicate, thin yarn. They are measured by diameter in mm.
        </p>
        <p>Another aspect is the kind of needle. There are a few types: straight needles, circle needles, and double pointed needles. They
          are all useful for different projects: circle needles for hats and socks, straight needles for scarves and blankets, etc. We list some common needle choices below.
        </p>
        <code>//The way to choose needles is with this formula: idealNeedleThickness + needleType = idealNeedleForProject</code>
        <ul>
          <li>.5mm straight needles</li>
          <li>2.5mm circle needles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>An important factor to consider when it comes to yarn is the thickness of the yarn. Thicker yarn will help you make bushier sweaters and blackets,
          while with a thinner yarn you can make more intricate patterns for hats, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Another important fact to consider is the type of yarn, the material itself. For colder months, wool would be a good material, while cotton is good for a lighter feel.
          We will list some popular yarns used for knitting projects.
        </p>
        <code>//When picking a yarn to use for your project, the formula is
                yarnType + yarnThickness = idealYarnForProject
        </code>
        <ul>
          <li>Thick wool</li>
          <li>Thin cotton</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          One of the first things to consider when choosing a possible project is what
          kind of item you would like to knit. For example, on the beginner side, you can start with
          a scarf or a blanket, something that only requires straight needles. On the more advanced side,
          you can make a sweater, a hat, mittens, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important factor is what kind of pattern you want to knit. Just with knit and purl
          stitches alone, there are so many combinations and patterns. More complicated patterns will
          include stitches like slip stitch, yarn over, etc. You can see the equation down below. We will also
          list some popular projects down below.
        </p>
        <code>
          //So, as said above, you can think of picking a project like solving an equation
          knittedItem + knitPattern = finishedProject
        </code>
        <ul>
          <li> Honeycomb Sweater</li>
          <li> Ribbed scarf</li>
          <li> Knit Beanie</li>
